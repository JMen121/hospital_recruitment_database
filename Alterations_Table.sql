-- What I have done so far
/* Create a database with at least 3 tables with several columns, use good naming conventions
Link tables using primary and foreign keys effectively
+ Populate the database with at least 8 rows of mock data per table to show use of DML
commands. The data does not need to be real or accurate.
Use at least 3 different data types while creating tables
+ Use at least 2 constraints while creating tables, not including primary key or foreign key YES
+ Use at least 3 queries to insert data
